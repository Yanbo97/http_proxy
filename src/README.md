1. ETag
   ETag (Entity Tag) is a response header used to determine if a cached version of a resource is identical to the current version on the server. It helps with efficient resource updates and cache validation, minimizing data transfer for unchanged resources.
2. Last-Modified
   Last-Modified is a response header indicating the date and time a resource was last changed. Like the ETag, it's used in cache validation to determine if a resource has been updated since it was last fetched.
3. no-cache
   no-cache is a directive in the Cache-Control header that allows a cached resource to be reused only if it is validated with the origin server. This means the cache must check with the origin server for updates before serving the cached content, although the content can still be stored in cache.
4. no-store
   no-store is a more stringent directive in the Cache-Control header indicating that the response must not be stored in any form of cache (either private or shared caches). It's used for sensitive information that should not be cached.
5. must-revalidate
   must-revalidate is a directive indicating that once a resource becomes stale (past its expiration time), it must not be used again until it is revalidated with the origin server. This ensures that users always receive the most up-to-date content or no content at all if the server cannot be reached.
6. private
   private is a directive indicating that the response is intended for a single user and must not be stored by shared caches (e.g., proxy servers). It can still be cached in a private cache (e.g., a user's browser).
7. max-age=0
   max-age is a directive specifying the maximum amount of time (in seconds) a resource is considered fresh. A max-age=0 effectively means the cached version of the resource is immediately considered stale and must be revalidated before use.
8. chunked
   chunked is not directly a cache control directive but a transfer encoding method indicated by the Transfer-Encoding: chunked header. It allows the server to send a response in chunks without knowing its entire content length beforehand. This is useful for streaming or dynamically generated content. While not a cache directive, its presence might affect how you handle caching since chunked responses may need to be handled differently, especially if you are caching the body of responses.
   Understanding these attributes and directives is crucial for implementing effective caching strategies in your proxy server, as they directly influence the freshness, validity, and privacy of cached responses.
